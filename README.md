## Installing procedure for Ubuntu
In my case it was WSL (Ubuntu 18.04).
I am using python 3.6.7
`sudo apt install python3`
`sudo apt-get install python-pip`
`pip install cma`
`pip install numpy`
`pip install matplotlib`

There was a problem due to the lack of GUI (X server would be necessary) so I decided to use PowerShell instead.
Installing components were the same.
