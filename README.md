## Installing procedure for Ubuntu (prerequisities)
In my case it was WSL (Ubuntu 18.04).
I am using python 2.7
`sudo apt-get install python-pip`
`pip install numpy`
`pip install matplotlib`

There was a problem due to the lack of GUI (X server would be necessary) so I decided to use PowerShell instead. I would have to install MS Visual Studio in order to compile boost (v.1_72_0) dynamic libraries so i've decided to switch to Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.
Installing components were the same.

## Executing
Simply run `purecma_mod_sim.py` for tournament modification or `purecma_ref_sim.py` for reference cma (half winners from sorting by tfvalue).
